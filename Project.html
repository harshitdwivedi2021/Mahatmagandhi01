                        <h2>Father of the Nation in India</h2>
<p class="p1">Monhandas Karamchand Gandhi was born in the small town of Porbandar, on the west coast of India, on October 2 1869. He belonged by birth to the Vaishya, or trading caste. His father died when he was 15 years old, and apart from that time, his mother became the greatest influence in his life. Her spiritual teacher was a Jain devotee. Among the Jains in India the central doctrine is the "sanctity of all life," or Ahimsa, which is often translated as "non-violence." This teaching remained paramount with Gandhi.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Although Gandhi welcomed Britain’s exit, he wanted to maintain a united India where the Hindu, Muslim and Sikh peoples could co-exist. Therefore when Partition happened in 1947, Gandhi did not participate in any official celebrations and instead visited areas that were greatly affected by the ensuing violence.</b> </p>
<p class="p3">While many people supported Gandhi and his teachings, some Hindus believed that he was too supportive of Pakistan and Indian Muslims. Such views led militant Hindu nationalist Nathuram Godse to assassinate Gandhi at an inter-faith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948. Gandhi’s death was mourned across the nation, with over one million people joining his five-mile-long funeral procession. Today, his birthday is commemorated in India as a national holiday and worldwide as the International Day of Non-Violence. </p>
